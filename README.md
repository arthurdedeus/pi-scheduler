# Pi Scheduler

**Run checks on a schedule. Wake the agent when there’s something to do.**

Schedule shell commands, agent prompts, and reminders inside [Pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi). Commands run directly and bring their output back to the agent when your wake policy matches.

> “Run the tests every five minutes. Wake yourself if they fail. Stop after ten runs.”

## Why this package?

Pi Scheduler focuses on **scheduled actions**: run a command, capture stdout/stderr, and trigger a follow-up on success or failure. Execution limits, persistent tasks, and atomic claims let multiple Pi processes share scheduled work.

Prompt loops suit checks that need agent judgment every time. Broader packages such as [pi-loop](https://github.com/trvon/pi-loop) also provide workflows, event triggers, orchestration, and command monitoring. Choose Pi Scheduler when you want a focused scheduler for commands, prompts, and reminders.

**Pi must be running for tasks to fire.** Tasks persist across restarts, but this package does not run an always-on daemon.

## Get started

```bash
pi install npm:@jl1990/pi-scheduler
```

Restart Pi or run `/reload`. Ask for a scheduled task in plain language, or try:

```text
/remind 20m take a break
/schedule prompt 5m :: Check whether the deployment has finished.
/schedules
```

A compact widget shows upcoming tasks below the editor.

## Example: run tests, investigate failures

Ask Pi to schedule this, or use these arguments with its `schedule_task` tool:

```json
{
  "action": "shell",
  "type": "interval",
  "schedule": "5m",
  "command": "npm test",
  "timeoutMs": 120000,
  "wakeOn": "failure",
  "failurePrompt": "Review the test output, diagnose the failure, and report the cause.",
  "maxRuns": 10,
  "scope": "cwd"
}
```

Use a test command that finishes rather than entering watch mode. Every five minutes, the scheduler runs it and captures the result:

- **Pass:** no agent turn. Pi may still show execution notifications and result messages.
- **Non-zero exit or timeout:** wake the agent with stdout/stderr to investigate.
- **Ten executions:** disable the task automatically.

For recurring shell tasks, `stopOn` may be `success`, `failure`, or `never` (the default). It disables recurrence after the matching result; non-zero exits, timeouts, and killed commands count as failures. `stopOn` is independent of `wakeOn`.

Recurring tasks do not stop when an external goal completes unless configured with `stopOn`. Cancel them when finished, or bound them with `maxRuns`.

Use `expiresIn: "2h"` to stop starting new runs after two hours. The absolute deadline persists across restarts. Expiry is silent and visible as `expired` in task history; an already-running command finishes with its usual wake policy. Renew an expired task with a new `expiresIn`, or set it to `null` in `manage_scheduled_task` to clear the deadline and resume it.

## Scheduling options

| Option | Choices |
| --- | --- |
| Action | `shell` runs a command; `prompt` wakes the agent; `notify` shows a reminder; `message` adds a custom message |
| Schedule | `once`: `5m`, `tomorrow at 9am`, ISO datetime; `interval`: `30s`, `5m`, `1h`; `cron`: `0 0 9 * * 1-5` (weekdays at 9am) |
| Scope | `session` (default): creating session; `cwd`: sessions in the same project directory; `global`: any session |
| Limits | `maxRuns` caps executions; `timeoutMs` bounds each shell command; `expiresIn` sets a positive lifetime (for example `2h`) |
| `stopOn` | For shell actions, stop recurrence after `success`, `failure`, or `never` (default) |
| `backoff` | Interval-only `{ "factor": 2, "maxInterval": "15m" }` grows the delay after each execution, up to the cap |

Backoff applies to every outcome and persists across restarts. Updating the schedule or backoff, or explicitly enabling a task, resets the delay to the base interval. Set `backoff: null` to return to a fixed interval; remove it explicitly when switching to cron or once. Execution limits still count runs normally.

Cron uses `croner`; six-field expressions with seconds are recommended. Use `session` scope when a follow-up must return to a specific session. For shared scopes, the process that claims the task receives the follow-up.

### Shell wake policy

| `wakeOn` | Wake the agent when… |
| --- | --- |
| `failure` | The command exits non-zero or is killed/times out |
| `success` | The command exits 0 without being killed |
| `always` | Any run finishes |
| `never` | Never; just record the result |
| `change` | After the first run, when stdout, stderr, exit status, or killed/timeout state changes |

Use `successPrompt` or `failurePrompt` for outcome-specific instructions, or `followUpPrompt` for either outcome. The wake policy is checked first. Without an explicit policy, supplying a prompt defaults to `always`; otherwise the default is `never`. An explicit matching policy without a custom prompt uses a default review instruction.

`change` stores a SHA-256 fingerprint of the complete (untruncated) shell result in task state. The first run establishes the baseline without waking; repeated identical results stay quiet. Editing the command, working directory, or opting into `change` starts a new baseline. If that first run matches `stopOn`, the task stops silently; use `success` or `failure` when the stopping result must wake the agent.

**Exit status matters.** A command that prints a failed CI pipeline may still exit 0. For CI polling, use a command or wrapper that maps pipeline states to the intended exit status; pending is not automatically a separate state.

## Manage tasks

Ask Pi to list, update, disable, or remove tasks. Its tools are `schedule_task`, `list_scheduled_tasks`, `cancel_scheduled_task`, and `manage_scheduled_task`.

Completed runs keep a compact history of the latest 10 attempts (timestamps, duration, outcome, and wake disposition). Use `list_scheduled_tasks` with `includeHistory: true` (and optionally `id`) to inspect it; the default listing remains compact. `delivered` means a wake was submitted to Pi, not that an agent turn finished; `pending` means delivery was not yet recorded.

```text
/schedules                       # active tasks
/schedules all                   # include inactive tasks
/schedules history               # show compact run history
/schedule-cancel <id-or-prefix>
/schedule-enable <id-or-prefix>
/schedule-disable <id-or-prefix>
/schedule-remove <id-or-prefix>
/schedule-cleanup
/schedule-widget [on|off]
```

To create tasks directly:

```text
/schedule [notify|prompt|shell|message] [once|interval|cron|every] <schedule> :: <payload>
```

## Persistence and recovery

Tasks live in `~/.pi/agent/state/scheduler/tasks.json`. Atomic state transactions and task claims coordinate execution across Pi processes; shared state refreshes every five seconds.

A reported loss of the state lock fails the affected transaction instead of terminating Pi. Background storage failures are contained: failed claims retry after a successful refresh rather than immediately, and attempts unable to save completion or failure are recovered as interrupted once storage is available.

On restart, overdue one-shot and interval tasks run. Cron catches up the most recent missed occurrence per task, newest first, within these limits:

| Environment variable | Default |
| --- | --- |
| `PI_SCHEDULER_CATCHUP_WINDOW_H` | `24` hours |
| `PI_SCHEDULER_CATCHUP_MAX` | `5` tasks per startup; `0` disables cron catch-up |

Interrupted executions are recorded as failed: one-shot tasks remain failed, while recurring tasks are rescheduled. Shell commands run with your local user permissions.

## Run events for clients

Each shell run carries a structured `details.run` object on `scheduled-task` custom messages, so clients such as RPC frontends can show one live row per run:

| Phase | Message | Fields |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `start` | New message, sent with `display: false` before the command runs. Pi does not render it, and the scheduler removes it from model context. | `version`, `attemptId`, `startedAt`, `timeoutMs`, and `notice`: the exact text of the "Running scheduled command" notification, when a UI is present |
| `end` | The existing result message, or the existing execution-failure message | `version`, `attemptId`, `outcome` (`success` or `error`) |

A start and its end share `attemptId`, which also matches the run's `history` entry. A start without an end means the session changed or Pi stopped mid-run. Treat it as unresolved after `startedAt + timeoutMs`. Other actions send no run events.

## Prompt origin for clients

Prompt actions and shell wake follow-ups still reach the agent through `pi.sendUserMessage()`, so Pi stores them as ordinary user messages. When one lands, the scheduler appends a `scheduled-prompt` custom entry with `pi.appendEntry()`. Pi keeps custom entries out of model context. Clients receive the entry live as an `entry_appended` event and later through `get_entries`.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `version` | `1` |
| `kind` | `prompt` for a prompt action, `followUp` for a shell wake follow-up |
| `taskId`, `attemptId` | The task and the run that sent it. A follow-up shares `attemptId` with its shell run. |
| `name` | The task name, when set |
| `message` | `timestamp` and `textLength` of the user message it describes |

The scheduler writes an entry only when Pi reported the input as extension-sourced and the message text is a prompt the scheduler just sent. If another extension rewrites the text, the message gets no entry. The entry never repeats the prompt text.
